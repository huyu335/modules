# Overview

### Introduction

The MSKCC-Omics-Workflows Modules repository provides assistance in sharing and implementing components for development of Nextflow  workflows at MSKCC. It is an extension of the [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) repository, leveraging many of the same standards and compatibility with the nf-core support features, but offering components that are customized to and maintained exclusively by the MSKCC community.

### Getting Started

The mskcc-omics-workflows/modules repository is designed to be compatible with nf-core/tools, which is a helper package for developing pipelines, modules and subworkflows. Please read the [Getting started](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction) and [Installation](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) pages from nf-core documentation to get your environment up and running, and [nf-core tools documentation](https://nf-co.re/tools) to familiarize yourself with the helper tools.

If you would like to contribute a module or subworkflow to the mskcc-omics-workflows/modules repository, please refer to our documentation on [Contributing](contributing.md).

If you are developing a pipeline, please see the documentation on our available Modules and Subworkflows, and refer to our documentation for [Pipeline Development](pipeline-development.md).

### Software Requirements

You will need the following software to contribute a module to the mskcc-omics-workflows repository, or develop an nf-core pipeline:

* &#x20;[nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
* &#x20;[nf-test](https://www.nf-test.com/)
* &#x20;[nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/)
